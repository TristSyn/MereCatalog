MereCatalog

Goal

A basic ORM framework with as close to POCO as possible domain objects. i.e. minimal if any decorations through attributes. Associated domain objects (through foreign key relationships) should be populated automatically where intuitively possible (or through attributes if necessary).

Solution

Reflection

Future work
- more abstracted database connectivity
- Lazy Loading if wished
- Linq and/or Lambda style querying
- better sql querying abilities (<, >, <=, >=, like, etc)
